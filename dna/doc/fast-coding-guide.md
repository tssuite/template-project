## ‚úÖ Quick Open Files

In VS Code, always quick open files by pressing `Cmd+P`, then typing fragments
of the file path or name, and pressing `Enter`.

> üí° Tip: You can also use `Cmd+Shift+P` to open the Command Palette, but `Cmd+P` is faster for files.

## ‚úÖ Multi-Cursor Search and Replace

In VS Code:

1. Double-click a word to select it.
2. Press `Ctrl+D` repeatedly to select all occurrences.
3. Modify the word across all cursors.
4. Press `Esc` to exit multi-cursor mode.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è By default, search is not case-sensitive.

To enable case-sensitive multi-cursor selection:

- Press `Cmd+F`
- Click the `Aa` icon to enable case sensitivity
- Now use `Ctrl+D` for case-sensitive selection
