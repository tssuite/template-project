## Vscode Windows: Debugging is not working

Date: 2025-03-08

⚠️ IMPORTANT: On Windows, please check out the repo on drive C. There is a bug
in the VS Code Vitest extension (v1.14.4), which prevents test debugging from
working: <https://github.com/vitest-dev/vscode/issues/548> Please check from
time to time if the issue has been fixed and remove this note once it is
resolved.
